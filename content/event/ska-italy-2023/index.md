title: EOR, Cosmic Dawn and the SKA

event: Fourth Italian SKA Workshop
event_url: https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/2535/

location: Catania, Italy

summary: I gave an invited scientific overview of EoR, Cosmic Dawn, and Italy's involvement in the SKA.
abstract: 'The first billion years of cosmic history is still essentially uncharted 
territory, and promises an enticing range of scientific discovery once its frontiers 
have been breached. After the well-studied epoch of recombination, three major distinct 
phases of cosmological evolution occur: the so-called Dark Ages which witness the 
widespread collapse from pristine linearity via dark-matter dominated halo growth, the 
Cosmic Dawn in which the first luminous sources awaken, and finally the Epoch of 
Reionisation (EOR) in which the inter-galactic hydrogen is ultimately ionised. The 
luminous sources from these epochs are being targeted by advanced space telescopes, like
JWST, but these are limited to the highly-biased sample of very brightest sources. The 
SKA will play an absolutely pivotal role in transforming our understanding of the first 
billion years, by mapping the integrated contribution of all thermal processes over the
 vast 3D cosmic lightcone, via the 21cm spectral line of neutral hydrogen.

In this talk, I will give an overview of the exciting science awaiting us once we unlock
this treasure trove of information. I will also outline the many significant challenges
that obstruct this goal, as well as recent advancements and lessons learned from 
international "pathfinder" experiments that have made great progress towards 
overcoming these challenges. Finally, I will look to the future, summarizing the 
prospects for the SKA and the many synergies between the SKA and other probes of 
Cosmic Dawn.'
