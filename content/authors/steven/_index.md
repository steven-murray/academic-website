      My MSCA fellowship project 'FORWARD' focused on developing
      Bayesian methods of understanding the full, correlated error budget of 
      21cm experiments like HERA, EDGES and the SKA.

      At ASU, I worked with the HERA interferometer and the EDGES global signal
      experiment, as well as leading development of the 21cmFAST simulation package.
      For HERA, I helped lead the Validation team, designing and running some of the 
      most sophisticated instrumental simulations in the world. For EDGES, I have 
      developed a new robust analysis pipeline to help confirm the potential first-ever
      detection of Cosmic Dawn.

      At ICRAR-Curtin, I worked within the EoR group, developing theoretical 
      models in the context of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). I contributed to
      models of the ionosphere, as well improving statistical models of bright 
      foregrounds.

I am a Senior Lecturer at the [Stellenbosch University School of Physics](https://physics.sun.ac.za/) 
in Stellenbosch, South Africa. My research interests are in 21cm cosmology,
cosmological structure formation, Bayesian statistical analysis, and creating useful
open-source software for scientific applications.
