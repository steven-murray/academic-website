I am a Senior Lecturer at the [Stellenbosch University School of Physics](https://physics.sun.ac.za/) 
in Stellenbosch, South Africa. My research interests are in 21cm cosmology,
cosmological structure formation, Bayesian statistical analysis, and creating useful
open-source software for scientific applications.
