summary: |
  A python application that provides a flexible and simple way to calculate the 
  Halo Mass Function for a range of varying parameters.

  The Halo Mass Function is a critical quantity in determining 
  properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. It encodes the number of halos 
  of a given mass in a given volume of the Universe, and can be predicted from some 
  neat arguments given a cosmology that describes how the Universe is 
  expanding. The predictions can be used to compare to observations of galaxy clusters to 
  determine parameters of the large scale structure. The HMF is also a key ingredient in 
  more complex predictions of the Universe, via the [halo model](https://github.com/halomod/halomod).
