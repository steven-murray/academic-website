title: pydftools
summary: |
  A package that implements a statistical method for robust estimation of density functions
  for observables, eg. luminosity functions and mass functions of galaxies or haloes. 
  While I contributed to the statistical method itself, I was not the primary force
  behind the algorithm (that was [Danail Obreschkow](https://www.icrar.org/multimedia/interviews/dr-danail-obreschkow/).
  This package is my Python implementation of the method.
