I wrote [this memo](/uploads/power_spectrum_normalisation_and_sensitivity.pdf) 
quite a while back, trying to get some power spectrum noise 
calculations correct. I've shared it a few times with different folks, so I thought
I'd put it up here so that it's easier to find. Let me know if you find any errors!
