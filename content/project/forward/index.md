  FORWARD is the name of my Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship. It's not an acronym: it 
  is short for "Forward-Models of Cosmic Dawn: connecting 21cm simulations to the real 
  world". I am performing the fellowship at Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy.

FORWARD is the name of my Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship. It's not an acronym: it 
is short for "Forward-Models of Cosmic Dawn: connecting 21cm simulations to the real 
world". I am performing the fellowship at Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy.

What's it all about? Here's the abstract:

FORWARD will enable a new generation of transformational probes of Cosmic Dawn (CD) to provide meaningful inference on key
questions of galaxy formation. The CD contains some of the most sought-after insights into galaxy formation. Though these secrets
remain locked away by a host of formidable real-world challenges, upcoming radio telescopes are optimistic. Interferometers such as
HERA and future SKA, along with global experiments such as EDGES-3 are honed to observe the faint 21cm emission from neutral
Hydrogen, redshifted to 50-150 MHz, in complementary ways. The dominant limitation of current experiments are spectral
systematics that couple with overwhelmingly bright foregrounds. As we enter the regime in which the most extreme physical models
begin to be ruled out by observations, meaningful inference of key parameters is most susceptible to inaccuracies in accounting for
these systematics. Prior efforts to provide parameter constraints from CD have focused on forecasts, and treated systematics crudely
and optimistically. FORWARD will synthesise the popular semi-numerical simulation code 21cmFAST and a radically overhauled
parameter-inference engine, 21cmMC-2, with a series of new pluggable modules designed to efficiently forward-model the response
of realistic interferometers, enabling the most direct comparison of theory to data. By applying this novel machinery jointly to
observations from HERA and EDGES-3, we will (i) provide meaningful constraints on the parameters of galaxy formation during CD, (ii)
build confidence in the reported detections, and (iii) enable future joint constraints from the SKA & EDGES-3. The framework
developed will follow a legacy of code excellence, providing a bedrock for state-of-the-art developments over the coming years.
