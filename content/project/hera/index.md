title: HERA
summary: |
  The **Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array** is one of the largest radio
  interferometers in the world, and is looking to map the effects of the first stars,
  galaxies and black holes over the first billion years of the Universe.
  
  I co-lead the [Validation Team](https://github.com/hera-team/hera-validation),
  developing increasingly realistic simulations of our observations at scale. I also
  lead the development of an [interface](https://github.com/hera-team/pspec_likelihood)
  to compute theoretical likelihoods on HERA data.

The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is an experiment to detect spatial 
fluctuations of the hydrogen signature during Cosmic Dawn and EoR, primarily adopting
a delay-spectrum approach.
The HERA collaboration spans multiple universities in the US and some in Europe and South 
Africa. The telescope itself is an array (i.e. multiple low-frequency radio dishes 
joined together) located in the desert in South Africa.
