title: EDGES
summary: |
  The **Experiment to Detect the Global Eor Signal** is a "global 21cm signal" experiment. 
  It reported the [first evidence](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.05912.pdf) 
  of the very first stars in the Universe in 2018.

  I develop EDGES' analysis pipeline for everything from [data formats](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-io) 
  to [calibration](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-cal) to [data reduction](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-analysis) and 
  [interpretation](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-estimate). 
  I am particularly interested in validating  our pipeline with Bayesian statistical models.

The **Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signal** is a focused experiment that aims to 
detect the “global” signal from neutral hydrogen during the CD/EoR. It measures a 
single frequency spectrum averaged over the whole sky. This traces the total temperature
 of the intergalactic medium (IGM) as it evolves throughout cosmic time. The three 
 distinct antennas deployed by EDGES cover redshifts between 6 — 27, or from 
 7.7 — 13.3 billion years ago.
