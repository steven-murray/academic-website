title: SKA
summary: |
  The **SKA** will be the largest radio telescope ever built, with a collecting area of
  over a square kilometre. It will be able to detect the faintest signals from the
  early Universe, and will be able to image the sky with unprecedented resolution.

  I am a member of the [EoR and Cosmic Dawn Science Working Group](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/science-working-groups/106/epoch-reionization),
  contributing to the development of our tools and techniques, to be ready for the insane
  amount of data we're going to get when SKA comes online.
