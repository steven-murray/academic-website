title: hera-sim
summary: |  
  hera_sim is one of the primary codes I contribute to in the [HERA software suite](https://github.com/hera-team/). 
  It is geared at simulating HERA-specific instrumental effects (thermal noise, cross-coupling, 
  cable reflections) and injecting them into simulated visibilities.

  This code is central to validating HERA's analysis pipeline (as discussed in the linked paper).
