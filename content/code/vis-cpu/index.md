title: matvis
summary: |  
  `matvis` is a visibility simulator: it computes what an interferometer (like [HERA](/projects/hera))
  would measure given a model of the sky. This process is incredibly computationally
  demanding for telescopes like HERA that have several hundred antennas (and, more
  importantly, several tens of thousands of *pairs* of antennas). `matvis` adopts a novel
  matrix-based approach to the computation that gets significant acceleration from modern
  GPUs. The original author of this code was Aaron Parsons. I have been the primary 
  maintainer and performance-enhancer in recent times.
