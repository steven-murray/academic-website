title: halomod
summary: |
  The halo model is a super-convenient analytic tool to predict the spatial distribution of 
  “things” in the Universe. It uses dark matter halos as the basic scaffolding, and then 
  associates other things with the halos — eg. galaxies or diffuse gas. The predictions 
  can be compared to observations of the spatial layout of galaxies, for example, to 
  determine either cosmological parameters or properties of the galaxies themselves.

  halomod provides an extremely simple -- but quite comprehensive and easy to extend
  and manipulate -- framework for computing quantities from the halo model. It builds
  on [hmf](https://github.com/halomod/hmf) (another of my codes) to 
  do this.
