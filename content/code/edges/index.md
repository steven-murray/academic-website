title: EDGES Analysis Pipeline
summary: |
  I am the primary developer of a new software pipeline for EDGES data. This involves 
  a stack of codes for
  [data reading/writing](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-io), 
  [calibration](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-cal), 
  [analysis](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-analysis) and 
  [parameter estimation](https://github.com/edges-collab/edges-estimate).

  The software is developed by a small team, and I am overseeing the 
  development, in order to transform the EDGES analysis pipeline into something that is 
  highly transparent, reproducible and accurate.
