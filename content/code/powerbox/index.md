title: powerbox
summary: |
  A small Python code that is all about power spectra in “boxes” of arbitrary 
  dimension. It can both create boxes with a given power spectrum, or determine the power 
  spectrum of a given box. It does all of this with a lot of generality — we’re not just 
  talking about 2- or 3-dimensional boxes, but boxes with an arbitrary number of dimensions 
  (as long as your computer has enough memory!). Bring on the 5-dimensional cubes!
