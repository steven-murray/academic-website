title: TheHaloMod
summary: |
  TheHaloMod is a web-application that uses my Python codes [hmf](https://gitub.com/halomod/hmf) 
  and [halomod](https://github.com/halomod/halomod) to 
  calculate halo model quantities, and serve up plots directly without ever having to 
  install the codes, from the comfort of your web browser.

  The purpose of `TheHaloMod` is to be useful both for researchers and also students approaching
  research into large-scale structure. `TheHaloMod` was formerly known as `HMFcalc`, 
  and has been well-used since its creation in 2013. `TheHaloMod` adds extra goodies to 
  the original `HMFcalc` â€” namely, the ability to calculate correlation functions and 
  power spectra of galaxies.

  From June 2021, TheHaloMod has become a shiny new single-page app, developed by a very
  talented group of Computer Science undergrads at ASU.
