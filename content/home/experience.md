      At ASU, I work with the HERA interferometer and the EDGES global signal
      experiment, as well as leading development of the 21cmFAST simulation package.
      For HERA, I help lead the Validation team, designing and running some of the 
      most sophisticated instrumental simulations in the world. For EDGES, I have 
      developed a new robust analysis pipeline to help confirm the potential first-ever
      detection of Cosmic Dawn.

      At ICRAR-Curtin, I worked within the EoR group, developing theoretical 
      models in the context of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). I contributed to
      models of the ionosphere, as well improving statistical models of bright 
      foregrounds.
